        <li>Peel and then slice apples.</li>
        <li>Place the peeled, sliced apples in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>
          Add the vanilla, ¼ cup flour, granulated sugar and brown sugar to the
          bowl with the apples. Sprinkle the cinnamon, nutmeg and salt over the
          apples. Stir to combine. Set aside while you make the pie crust.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="crust">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted
          with the steel blade. (Alternatively, the pie crust dough can be made
          by hand in a large bowl using a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut
          in the butter.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Pulse to combine the dry ingredients. Add the cold butter cubes and
          pulse about 10 times, until the largest butter pieces are the size of
          small peas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the ice-cold water and pulse just until the dough comes together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and form it into
          a ball. Cut the ball in half and shape each half into a round disk.
          Wrap one of the disks in plastic wrap and place it in the
          refrigerator.
        </li>
        <li>
          On a lightly floured work surface, roll the second disk out to a
          12-inch round and transfer it to a deep-dish pie pan. (This is easily
          done by wrapping the dough round around your rolling pin to help move
          it.)

    <h1>Assemble The Pie!</h1>
    <div class="finalbake">
      <ol>
        <li>
          By this time, the apples should have released some of their juices.
          Stir the apple mixture to make sure everything is well combined and
          then pour the apples and their juices into the pie crust.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll out the second pie dough disk to a 12-inch round. You can place
          the dough round on top of the pie as is, or you can make a lattice-top
          pie crust. If putting the full dough round on top of the pie, cut a
          few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape as the pie bakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          To make a lattice top pie crust (see step-by-step photos in the post
          above): Cut the second dough round into ½-inch strips. Place the
          longest strip down the center of the pie. Reserving every other dough
          strip to go in the other direction on the pie, lay strips across the
          pie with just a little bit of space between. Then weave in strips
          going the opposite direction on the pie.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trim the edges of the pie crust so that there is a ½-inch overhang
          over the edge of the pie dish. Fold the overhang under itself and
          flute/crimp the edges of the crust as desired.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brush the pie crust with milk (to help with browning and to help the
          coarse sugar stick) and sprinkle with coarse sugar, if desired.
        </li>
        <li>Refrigerate pie for 30 minutes before baking.</li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400° F with a rack in the lower third of
          the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake the pie at 400° for 20 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to
          350° F. Continue baking the pie for 40-50 minutes more, until the
          filling is bubbly. Check on the pie partway through the baking time
          and tent it with foil as needed to prevent the crust from
          over-browning (to tent with foil means to loosely cover the pie by
          laying a sheet of foil over the top).
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the pie cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours before
          serving to allow the filling to thicken.
        </li>
        <li>
          Store pie at room temperature for up to one day, or in the
          refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 5 days. Pie can
          also be frozen, wrapped tightly, for up to 3 months.
        </li>
